## Instructions



### Add a Counter to the Header component

This counter should show the total number of *incomplete* events, and be located in the Header component.

### Create left menu nav with one item

Create a left nav column, with one nav item containing the name of your list. You could call it 'Default' or 'Personal'. It doesn't matter.

### Responsive layout

Create two breakpoints, and hide the left menu behind a link, or an icon, in the header when viewing in mobile breakpoint.

### Add second list

Create a second list and add a link for it in the left nav menu. Now these two left nav links will link to their respective lists.

User can now create a ToDo in one or the other list.

### Add Footer

Add a sticky footer (pinned to bottom of browser) and center your name within this.

## Extra Credit

- Add feature to let user create/delete lists

- Persist lists after refresh
